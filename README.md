## Usage

Download the latest release application from the **Releases** page.

All our applications on Linux are provided in an **AppImage** format. It requires making the file into executable before using it. 

Check the box that says **Allow executing file as program** as shown in the image.

![Demo Image](https://github.com/acute-technology-inc/dso-release/blob/main/res/image.png?raw=true)

Or, you can type

```
    chmod 777 Digital_Storage_Oscilloscope-x86_64.AppImage
```

Simply double-click the file to launch the application after the file is changed into an executable file.

devices. Thus, you may need to install the udev rule file that you can obtain from
`LinuxSoftwareResources.tar.gz`.

    sudo cp 99-AcuteUSB.rules /etc/udev/rules.d
    ```

3.	Restart PC.
